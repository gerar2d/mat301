#A virus of unknown origin has swept across the earth, 
#causing a global pandemic. A person may truly be infected with the virus (V+), 
#or may truly not be infected with the virus (V-). 
#A test for the virus (T) has a false positive rate of Pr(T+|V-) = 0.006. 
#The true positive rate for T however is Pr(T+|V+) = 0.91. 
#The background prevalence (prior) rate of infection 
#in New York City is Pr(V+) = 0.0745. 
#Compute the following: 

#Express all your answer probabilities below, as decimals between 0 and 1. 

# a. Compute Pr(T- | V+): 0.0745
